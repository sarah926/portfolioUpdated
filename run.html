    <h3>Product Analysis:</h3>
    <a style="text-decoration: underline;font-style: italic;" href="https://github.com/sarah926/running-for-it">See on Github</a>
    <p>
        <strong>Customer Problem: </strong>Users find it difficult to sustain their
        interest in running due to hidden paywalls and non-intuitive interfaces.<br> <br>
        <strong>KPI:</strong> Sign up a minimum of 50 users, with 50% of them completing more than 5 tracked workouts.
        <br><br><strong>Goals: </strong>
    <ul>
        <li> Develop an iOS app with options for Apple Watch and IPhone.</li>
        <li>Provide a user friendly interface to easily track workouts and follow a beginner program.</li>
        <li>Create a better user experience with no paywalls compared to other apps in the market.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Role:</strong> Software developer, product analyst.
    <strong>Technologies Utilized:</strong> SwiftUI, Figma.
    <strong>User Journey:</strong>
    <ol>
        <li>User downloads the application from the apple app store.</li>
        <li>The user is given one or 2 screens of introduction of the app and its purpose.</li>
        <li>The user enters personal information to set up an account.</li>
        <li>The user selects what level of runner they are - beginner, intermediate, or advanced.</li>
        <li>The user is taken to a home page, where they will be able to see their data after they complete their first
            workout.</li>
        <li>The user can easily click start workout when they are ready.</li>
        <li>The user can see the interval information on their phone, including the time left and if it is a walk or run
            interval.</li>
        <li> If the user turns off their phone while they are running, the app will beep so they know it is time to
            switch.</li>
        <li>After the workout is done, the user will be able to see a summary.</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>Development Journey:</strong> <br>
   <strong>May:</strong>Customer problem identified. Started taking a Udemy course on Swift development.
    <br>
    <Strong>June: </Strong>Started developing without a clear design idea. Utilizing development to learn more Swift.
    <br>
    <Strong>July: </Strong>Created a new design concept. Wireframing in Figma.
    <br>
    <strong>August: </strong>Implemented the new design.
    <br>
    <strong>Going Forward:</strong> Still issues to workout, the design is professional but still some functionality missing.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>
    Original Design For Comparison:</strong>
    <br>
    <div class="grid-old-design">
        <img src="images/Running for it (1).png" class="grid-item-about" style="width: 100%">
        <img src="images/Running for it (3).png" class="grid-item-about"style="width: 100%">
        <img src="images/Running for it (5).png" class="grid-item-about"style="width: 100%">
    </div>
    <br>
    <strong>Learnings:</strong>
    With additional time and resources I would have liked to understand metrics on the following:
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>User engagement - What keeps users motivated and returning to the app; what features or 
            content has the biggest impact on MAU</li>
        <li>Launching to the app store.</li>
        <li>How does personalization factor in to the success of the app</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Challenges:</strong>
        <br>
        Over the course of the project, some challenges I encountered were:
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Coded before had a fully developed design.</li>
            <li>Functionality.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
